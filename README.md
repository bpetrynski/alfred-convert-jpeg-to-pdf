# Alfred Convert JPEG to PDF
An Alfred workflow that allows you to swiftly convert JPEG images to PDF format.

Note: When multiple files are selected, they are merged into a single PDF. The name of the output file is based on the first selected JPEG, and if there are multiple files, "_merged" is appended to its name.
